**1. Ensuring Functionality and Security**

I ensure my code and software are functional and secure by writing tests that cover all expected behaviors and edge cases. For example, I test both valid and invalid inputs to confirm the program behaves correctly and handles errors safely. I also follow best practices like input validation, exception handling, and using efficient data structures, which helps prevent logic errors and vulnerabilities.

**2. Interpreting User Needs**

I interpret user needs by carefully reviewing the requirements and clarifying any ambiguities. I translate these needs into functional specifications that guide my implementation. For instance, if a requirement says task IDs must be unique and fields must have maximum lengths, I enforce these rules in the code through validation checks and structured data management. This ensures the software behaves as users expect.

**3. Approach to Designing Software**

When designing software, I take a structured approach by first understanding the problem and defining clear requirements. I then break the system into modular components with clear responsibilities, choosing data structures and algorithms that optimize performance. For example, I separated the Task class (data) from TaskService (management) and used a HashMap for efficient task lookups. I also consider maintainability and future changes during the design to create robust and scalable software.
